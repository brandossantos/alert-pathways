    "Welcome to Expel's Jupyter Hub server! Expel uses Jupyter Hub to facilitate innovation internally in a way that is transparent and accessible to employees. With that said, there are some rules of the road that need to be observed to keep our (and our customer's) data safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules\n",
    "1. **Do not hard code passwords or API keys into notebooks.** If you need to access resources please use temporary tokens or input the API keys, passwords using `getpass`. Please see [Workbench Authentication](../examples/Workbench_Auth.ipynb) for an example.\n",
    "2. You do not have permissions to edit notebooks belonging to other users. If you want to make changes to another user's notebook, can clone it to your home directory and edit there. "

    "* Q: Can I store customer data in Jupyter Hub?\n",
    " * A: Yes, just upload the files you need in your home directory\n",
    "* Q: Do I need to encrypt or compress data I upload?\n",
    " * A: No, the underlying file system is encrypted and we can always expand disk space as needed.\n",
    "* Q: I have a question not answered here, where do I go?\n",
    " * A: Slack obviously, check out #jupyterhub"
